<p>To be good at using git, you need not only to learn it but you need to understand it. Git's working seems like magic until you understand why it does what it does.</p>
<p>This is the three best resources i've found for understanding how git works.&nbsp;I've you use git and don't know these, i suggest you take a look.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Git Parable&nbsp;</strong>- (blogpost:&nbsp;<a title="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html" href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html">http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html</a>)<br />Tom Preston-Werner has written a great blogpost describing how you might come to design a VCS like git. Now this is a made up story, but provides insights into the reasoning on the design &nbsp;for git.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Git for Ages 5 and Up</strong> - (presentation: <a title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwIwi80bXX4" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwIwi80bXX4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwIwi80bXX4</a>)<br />As you probably already know, git works internally with its commits in a graph-structure. This presentation explains and runs through examples in git while illustrating what git does using Tinker Toys. This may sound weird but is actually a great way to understand git's internal structure.</p>
<p><strong>Think Like A Git</strong>&nbsp;- (website:&nbsp;<a title="http://think-like-a-git.net/" href="http://think-like-a-git.net/">http://think-like-a-git.net/</a>)<br />A site that more directly describes git for "Advances beginners".</p>
