<p>I recently discovered James Shore's most excellent "Lets Play TDD" series. It's&nbsp;a series of screencasts all of around 15 minuttes, which shows the building of a java application from the start with TDD - and this live, with all the choices and hick-ups and whatever included.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm only just reached episode 22 so far, and he's made over a 100 at the time of writing this post. I will highly recommend this to anyone that wants to learn more about TDD in a real project.</p>
<p>As with Kent Becks TDD screencasts, its always great to see the different styles of TDD, i find it a great way to learn more. And James seems to almost produce episodes faster than i have time to watch them :).</p>
<p>First blog post about the series:<a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Lets-Play/Lets-Play-Test-Driven-Development.html">http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Lets-Play/Lets-Play-Test-Driven-Development.html</a></p>
