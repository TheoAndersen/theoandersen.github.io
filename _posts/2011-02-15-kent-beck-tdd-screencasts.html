<p>A good resource for anybody wanting to learn more about Test Driven Development, is the 4 screencasts by Kent Beck, which can be bought from The Pragmatic Bookshelf site.   <br /><a href="http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kbtdd/test-driven-development">http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kbtdd/test-driven-development</a></p>
<p>This is Kent Beck describing the workflow he uses when doing TDD and is a great way to learn a bit more about it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Mark Needham&rsquo;s comments of the screencasts:   <br /><a href="http://www.markhneedham.com...kent-becks-test-driven-development-screencasts/">http://www.markhneedham.com...kent-becks-test-driven-development-screencasts/</a></p>
<p>Interesting points to notice about the approach</p>
<ul>
<li><em>He starts of writing the code inside the test</em>, and first pulls it out into its own class when its justified to do so. This way its easier to start, as we don&rsquo;t have to find out how we want the design of the class/classes, before we have the code to put in there.</li>
<li><em>Smaller tests are removed, when bigger tests cover the same parts</em>. As tests must be maintained, it makes sense not to have multiple test covering the same areas.</li>
<li>Kent tries to <em>Call hits shots</em>, when running the unit tests, meaning that he tries to predict if the test is going to evaluate to red or green, as a exercise when TDD&rsquo;ing. </li>
</ul>
