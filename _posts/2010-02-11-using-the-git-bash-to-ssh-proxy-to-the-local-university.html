ssh -D 9999 tha@ssh.itu.dk

This makes an ssh connection to the ssh.itu.dk (IT University of Copenhagen) and adds a socks proxy on localhost port 9999. 

Only problem was that i ended up only being able to set firefox up correctly.. socks proxy through localhost:9999.

But that worked like a charm, and i could now connect to various article databasess that are only available through itu's network.

nice. :)
