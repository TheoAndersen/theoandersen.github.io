<p>Web developers should already be familiar with JQuery. It's an opensouce JavaScript library that makes writing simpler and more effective JavaScript possible. And it's made to abstract away differences between browsers.</p>
<p>Actually it requires nothing more than a JavaScript library that you download and reference. <br /><br />Normally i would show some JQuery code here, but as i'm myself just starting learning and using JQuery, I will just tell you that there's a good tutorial and info about JQuery on its site: <a href="http://jquery.com/">http://jquery.com/</a></p>
