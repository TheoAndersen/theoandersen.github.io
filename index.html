  <div class="entry-content"><p>After reading Ulrik Born&rsquo;s MSDN article on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dn451442.aspx">Adaptive Access Layers</a> (AAL) and hearing him present it at my company, I thought it would be a nice little exercise to start on a spike of an AAL framework.</p>

<p>The AAL spike code can be found on: <a href="http://www.github.com/TheoAndersen/AdaptiveAccessLayerSpike">github.com/TheoAndersen/AdaptiveAccessLayerSpike</a></p>

<p>The general idea is that every external dependency of the system as ex. database access, logging etc. is handled by an AAL-framework which dynamically creates the implementation of the interfaces you provide from your business logic, to use the external dependencies. So if you need a logging mechanism, you would create an interface with the right attributes to denote that its an interface providing access to the logger. The framework would then create an implementation for the interface and wire it up to the logging part of the framwork, without the code using the interface knowing about this.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/assets/aal-class-diagram.png"></p>

<p>This class diagram shows the structure I&rsquo;ve used in the spike. The ITestLogWriter represents an interface created by some business logic. The implementation is dynamically created by the AAL code, which wires it up to the LogContract derived AAL class, which handles the actual logging.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='csharp'><span class='line'><span class="na">[LogContract]</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This is how an interface could look like. The implementation that the AAL framework would create to hook this interface would then look like this.</p>

<p>Now this would be generated directly in MSIL code. As can be seen from the class diagram as well, the AdaptiveLayerBase implements an ExecuteImpl method which fits together with the standard IL code. This fits together with an abstract Execute method, which is what the specific AAL layers must implement to act on any message executed on an AAL interface.</p>

<p>Now i wont post any crazy IL generating code here, you can look at the github repo yourself for the part i&rsquo;ve tried out, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel to me like very sturdy code. The method i used to find out what IL to write, was that i created the implementation in c# first and then used the &ldquo;ildasm&rdquo; tool to disassemble the dll and watch what IL code it compiled into, so that i could use that as a recipe for my implementation. Still its poor error handling you get when the generated assembly just doesn&rsquo;t work, which is also a good reason to keep the generated IL part as small and simple as possible, and keep the normal c# code doing the lifting.</p>

<h2>Good reasoning behind an advanced implementation</h2>

<p>Now I like the overall reasoning behind this approach, but I&rsquo;m not sure I like the actual solution. The positives are that you enforce seperation of the external dependencies behind interfaces, to make sure that the business logic isn&rsquo;t tangled to much along with other concerns. The interface without a compile time implementation is though a little special. It makes the wiring of all business logic with external dependencies dynamic, so that every request will go through several &lsquo;magic&rsquo; holes in the code all the time. Debugging will be kind of odd as the current position will disappear and (hopefully) appear the right place on the other side.</p>

<p>I do think that the reasoning behind AAL of separating and generalizing/encapsulating external dependencies behind abstractions as interfaces are important in enterprise applications and that the referred anti-patterns are very real. Even though, it is though possible to achieve this if you continuously refactor and improve the code your working on. Much development seems opposed to continuous refactoring and generalization. Developers often just continue in the existing track, and dosen&rsquo;t think to refactor or change what theyr externding to make it better, making it necessary to come up with an architecture/framework like this up front. I think its impressive that Ulriks team has created this architecture and have extended it as much to really improve the productivity of theyr team, but i would optimally like a team to gradually mold a and continuously refactor a system to keep it easy to use and test, without having to create a framework with restrictions on how the developers have to work (even though its an internally developed framework). If we dont get developers to think critically on the code and refactor it, we will just have to create a new framwork to the business logic as well at some time, to keep them from messing that up, and so further.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>To be good at using git, you need not only to learn it but you need to understand it. Git&#8217;s working seems like magic until you understand why it does what it does.</p>
<p>This is the three best resources i&#8217;ve found for understanding how git works.&nbsp;I&#8217;ve you use git and don&#8217;t know these, i suggest you take a look.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Git Parable&nbsp;</strong>- (blogpost:&nbsp;<a title="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html" href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html">http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html</a>)<br />Tom Preston-Werner has written a great blogpost describing how you might come to design a VCS like git. Now this is a made up story, but provides insights into the reasoning on the design &nbsp;for git.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Git for Ages 5 and Up</strong> - (presentation: <a title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwIwi80bXX4" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwIwi80bXX4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwIwi80bXX4</a>)<br />As you probably already know, git works internally with its commits in a graph-structure. This presentation explains and runs through examples in git while illustrating what git does using Tinker Toys. This may sound weird but is actually a great way to understand git&#8217;s internal structure.</p>
<p><strong>Think Like A Git</strong>&nbsp;- (website:&nbsp;<a title="http://think-like-a-git.net/" href="http://think-like-a-git.net/">http://think-like-a-git.net/</a>)<br />A site that more directly describes git for &#8220;Advances beginners&#8221;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Using unit tests in XCode you have the posibility to have two test targets (sub-projects) set up; one for <em>logic tests</em> and one for <em>application tests</em>. So whats the difference?</p>
<p><em>Logic tests</em> run without the Application running, so you wont be able to reach your app-delegate or anything UI related, but you will be able to test POOC&#8217;s (Plain Old Obj-C Classes). The <em>Application Tests</em> target, will start up the simulator and use it to run your unit tests.</p>
<p>When i develop, i normally use the logic tests target for the classes providing domain behaviour. Not having to start up the simulator makes theses tests fast to run, making the feedback cycle shorter and you always want as short a feedback cycle as you can get.&nbsp;So when implementing a new feature i start up with the base domain behaviour and make it run with the logic tests. I then i move to the GUI, which uses this new feature and implement it with tests in the Application tests target. With this working i can then wire up the nibs or similar and start up the simulator to check that the feature works as it should.</p>
<p>It did initially seem a bit odd to have two unit test targets, but being that the one needs the simulator to run it makes sense.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever added a file to .gitignore and found that it still kept being added to the index? Well this is because git will only ignore files not currently under source control, or only files that its not already tracking.</p>

<p>To fix this, tell git to stop tracking the file:
<pre>
git rm &#8211;cached filename
</pre></p>

<p>This is usable for when you discover a file thats already been commited which should be ignored.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently discovered James Shore&#8217;s most excellent &#8220;Lets Play TDD&#8221; series. It&#8217;s&nbsp;a series of screencasts all of around 15 minuttes, which shows the building of a java application from the start with TDD - and this live, with all the choices and hick-ups and whatever included.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m only just reached episode 22 so far, and he&#8217;s made over a 100 at the time of writing this post. I will highly recommend this to anyone that wants to learn more about TDD in a real project.</p>
<p>As with Kent Becks TDD screencasts, its always great to see the different styles of TDD, i find it a great way to learn more. And James seems to almost produce episodes faster than i have time to watch them :).</p>
<p>First blog post about the series:<a href="http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Lets-Play/Lets-Play-Test-Driven-Development.html">http://jamesshore.com/Blog/Lets-Play/Lets-Play-Test-Driven-Development.html</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A good resource for anybody wanting to learn more about Test Driven Development, is the 4 screencasts by Kent Beck, which can be bought from The Pragmatic Bookshelf site.   <br /><a href="http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kbtdd/test-driven-development">http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-kbtdd/test-driven-development</a></p>
<p>This is Kent Beck describing the workflow he uses when doing TDD and is a great way to learn a bit more about it.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s Mark Needham&rsquo;s comments of the screencasts:   <br /><a href="http://www.markhneedham.com...kent-becks-test-driven-development-screencasts/">http://www.markhneedham.com&#8230;kent-becks-test-driven-development-screencasts/</a></p>
<p>Interesting points to notice about the approach</p>
<ul>
<li><em>He starts of writing the code inside the test</em>, and first pulls it out into its own class when its justified to do so. This way its easier to start, as we don&rsquo;t have to find out how we want the design of the class/classes, before we have the code to put in there.</li>
<li><em>Smaller tests are removed, when bigger tests cover the same parts</em>. As tests must be maintained, it makes sense not to have multiple test covering the same areas.</li>
<li>Kent tries to <em>Call hits shots</em>, when running the unit tests, meaning that he tries to predict if the test is going to evaluate to red or green, as a exercise when TDD&rsquo;ing. </li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The speed of development can be measured in how long it takes to write code, and then how long it takes to test that it works.</p>
<p>Now the normal way of testing is running the system and poke around in the area of the change, to confirm that the change works as it should. This can be very slow if you have to enter multiple hierarchy&#8217;s&nbsp; of nested pages or because the system simply takes a while to load and enter. This is where unit tests can be of help.</p>
<p>Even though you don&rsquo;t buy into the whole idea of covering everything with unit-tests, shortening the feedback cycle will shorten the time i takes to find out if your change works as it should, and this can be helped by testing through a unit-test instead of though the actual system.</p>
<p>I experienced this my self, when building a component that would allow other systems to integrate data our. In this case every request needed to convert input data, validate it, run validation against another external source (returned as json), and then save in the database. Now in this case, i found that creating simple unit tests, for testing the parts allowed me to build this more in component, and much faster, as i was shortening the feedback cycle. Now not every piece of code is straight forward to unit test. But at least evaluating the quickest/easiest way to test a piece of code, should be on every pragmatic programmers backbone.</p>

<p>I was looking at a similar piece of code on the project i&rsquo;m currently developer on at work, and was wondering why the first line of comments were there (i hate unnecessary comments, which clutter the meaning of the code). And then i realized that even though the first line of comments is clearly repeating whats really easily read in the expression in the if statement, it is making sure that that&rsquo;s what should be in the if-expression. If someone were to change the expression we would still have that line of code to make sure that the expression was what was originally intended.</p>

<p>Normally i wouldn&rsquo;t write the first line of comments, but only the second as it describes why we set the accounts ApprovalExpiryDate to the current DateTime, which isn&rsquo;t very clear. Even better would though be to extract the line in the if into a method that expressed what we try to explain in that comment line (SetAccountToBeReapproved() or something).</p>

<p>Now this is a stupid example yes, but the testing mindset is there. The best solution, and next step would then be to have a unit test check this, and enforce it automatically instead.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently Visual Studio 2008 has begun to act very slowly, taking minutes to start and shutdown whilst showing the grayed &#8220;not responding&#8221; at the same time, because windows can&#8217;t figure out what it&#8217;s doing either. I started uninstalling plugins as CodeRush, GitExtensions etc, but it didn&#8217;t help. Then googling the problem i found a suggestion as to remove the .suo file that lies in the same folder as the .sln file, and it worked! :S</p>
<p>Removing the .suo file which was about 50mb, took the visual studio ram usage from just over 1gb to 100mb, and Visual Studio is now much more responsive also. Very odd, but it seems a lot of people has the same experience. Sure hope this becomes better / more solid in VS2010.</p>
<p>So if Visual Studio begins to slow up, and take a lot of ram, then try renaming the .suo to .suoold or something, and see if it doesn&#8217;t help the performance. :)</p>
