    The speed of software development depends on the quality and quickness of solid feedback.
  </p>
  <p>
    The quicker the team gets solid feedback on where they're going, the quicker they get done, and the better the product becomes. Once you start thinking about this, you will notice how this is an underlying goal, behind many software practices and methodologies.
