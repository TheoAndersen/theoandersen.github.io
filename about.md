Iâ€™m a software developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark, working professionally with .NET as a Developer/Architect/Tema Lead and investigating anythning interesting on the isde.

Right now my interests are especially functional languages - in particular Elixir (on the Erlang VM) and Elm (a younger functional frontend language). I'm intruiged by agile team dynamics and scaling them, having worked several years on products panning multiple develppment teams.

I use this blog mostly for my own purpose of remembering stuff, and only get time to do so once in a while.
