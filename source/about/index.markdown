I'm a software developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark. I currently work professionally with .NET and anything interesting on the side.

I use this blog mostly for my own purpose of remembering stuff, and only get time to do so once in a while.

My current focus in on object oriented development and refactoring, Test driven development, git, javascript/node.js and IOS development.
