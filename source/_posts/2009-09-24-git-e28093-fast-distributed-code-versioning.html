title: "Git - Fast distributed code versioning"

<p>In case you haven&rsquo;t noticed, there's a new code versioning system around, that's gaining popularity fast.</p>
<p>Meet Git.. :)   <br /><a href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" src="http://dev.nettreo.com/images/image.png" border="0" alt="image" width="606" height="87" /></a>&nbsp; <br />(click to open git&rsquo;s homepage)</p>
<p>Now i am just starting to lean git, but as far as I've understood, here's are some of the main points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distributed model, as opposed to the normal centralized model from CVS and Subversion</strong> &ndash; this means that you don&rsquo;t see your versioning as working from one place all the time. You have your own repository that you commit to, and then you pull or push your changes to or from others from that. </li>
<li><strong>Your repository contains the whole history of git (the whole thing) locally</strong>&nbsp; &ndash;<strong> that both means that diff&rsquo;s and history lookups are dead fast</strong> &ndash; and also that you have images of everything lying on every person on the projects computer. </li>
<li><strong>Git tracks content not files</strong> &ndash; this means that there's better code-tracking even across files, and also makes it easier for it to merge content. </li>
<li><strong>Open source and made by Linus Thorvalds and his team</strong> &ndash; is currently used for versioning the Linux kernel. </li>
<li><strong>Most open source projects around are currently converting from subversion to it</strong>, because the distributed model suits open source project much better &ndash; also there's free hosting for open source projects on <a href="http://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>On Git&rsquo;s homepage you can find information, tutorials, and also a nice video of Linus expressing his view on code versioning.    <br /> <br />Now git is developed on linux, but there's a port for Windows called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list" target="_blank">msysGit</a> and extensions which add a nicer gui and visual studio support on sourceforge (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gitextensions/" target="_blank">GitExtensions</a>)</p>
<p>Now it seems that git is stronger and faster than Subversion which we normally use on our projects (or Team Foundation), but there's a slight learning hump to start with, as most people are used to a centralized versioning model, as CVS, SVN and Team Foundation (although you can of cause use a central repository with git also). Once people get more acquainted with git I'm sure it will gain even more popularity.</p>
<p>That's all for now on Git - once I've played around with it some more I'll write another post about my experiences.</p>
