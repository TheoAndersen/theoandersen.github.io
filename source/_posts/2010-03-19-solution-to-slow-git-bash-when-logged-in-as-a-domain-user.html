<p>Today i found that my newly installed git on my laptop at work was working pretty slow. 0.5 ~ 1sec delay on loading the git bash, and on every command. I logged in as a local user on the computer and the delay was gone.</p>  <p>Searching the internet a bit, i found that git uses the default home, on my account set to be a network account. This ment that git would look in this directory all the time, causing the delay.</p>  <p>To fix this i created a local user environment variable, overriding the default one, and setting it to %USERPROFILE% which points at c:\users\[username].</p>  <p><a href="http://dev.nettreo.com/images/image_4.png"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="image" border="0" alt="image" src="http://dev.nettreo.com/images/image_thumb_3.png" width="244" height="218" /></a></p>  <p>This makes git look the right place for the git.config.   <br />    <br />Next is that when you click the git bash shortcut, i opened on my default homedrive, which was a network connection.&#160; Looking at the properties for the shortcut it looks like this:</p>  <p><a href="http://dev.nettreo.com/images/Git%20Start%20In.png"><img style="border-bottom: 0px; border-left: 0px; display: inline; border-top: 0px; border-right: 0px" title="Git Start In" border="0" alt="Git Start In" src="http://dev.nettreo.com/images/Git%20Start%20In_thumb.png" width="244" height="195" /></a> </p>  <p>Changing the "Start in" to c:\user\[user], or any other place made the shortcut open much faster for me.</p>  <p>Now my git bash is back and fast again :)</p>
