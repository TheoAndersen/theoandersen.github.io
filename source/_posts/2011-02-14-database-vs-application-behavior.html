<ul>
<li>Database's work optimally on the stored data in the database, but not so well on in-memory data (not stored) / or not so easily. On the other side, applications cant store the data themselfes but does their work on in-memory data.</li>
<li>Database developers seem to prefer working out from the basedata, calculating data rather than creating cached data (which can be perferred for performance reasons).<br />This prefference of calculations seems to be because it is easier/nicer to make changes on calculations, rather than having to rework data (possibly historic). A change in a stored procedure and the data is correct again.</li>
