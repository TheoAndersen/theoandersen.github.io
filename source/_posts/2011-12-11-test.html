<h1 id="ivestartedusingemacsforeditingtext">I&rsquo;ve started using Emacs for editing text</h1>
<p>So! i&rsquo;ve begun using Emacs for editing text. And i&rsquo;m trying to use this on blogging as well, so this is sortof my test-blogpost.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m using Emacs (GNU), together with the program Markdown, which renders simple marked text, when it registers a change to a file.</p>
<p>Actually, another reason to me doing this is that i&rsquo;ve sort of converted to using Mac as my primary home computer (still use a Windows based computer at work), but there dosen&rsquo;t seem to be anything similar to Windows Live Writer on mac.</p>
<h2 id="formattingcode">Formatting code</h2>
<p>As many others i&rsquo;m using SyntaxHighlighter to highlight code:</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; gutter: false">if (some code here == 1)
{
 var something = 1;
 // this really won&rsquo;t compile in any language&hellip;
}
</pre>
<p>I can use HTML -tags in markdown, so this is quite easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>So. Im WLW i used to take a screencut, and just paste this right into the editor (pretty much). But now i guess i have to make a picture and refer to it using a normal &lt;img tag.</p>
